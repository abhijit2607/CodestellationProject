# CodestellationProject

The name of this project is HarmonyHub. 
It is a  platform rooted in our community that tackles issues affecting our neighborhood. To address these concerns and improve overall community well-being, the system will support proactive community building, uplift marginalized groups, and/or initiate public awareness campaigns.
